# Scrape-schema

This library is designed to write structured, readable, 
reusable parsers for various text data (like html, stdout or any text) and
is inspired by dataclasses

# Motivation
Simplifying parsers support, (mostly html, stdout output, unstructured text and unofficial APIs), 
where it is difficult to use or the complete absence of the **REST API**.

Also structuring, data serialization and use as an intermediate layer 
for third-party serialization libraries: json, dataclasses, attrs, pydantic, etc

# Install

zero dependencies (regex, nested fields)
```shell
pip install scrape-schema
```
add bs4 fields
```shell
pip install scrape-schema[bs4]
```

add selectolax fields
```shell
pip install scrape-schema[selectolax]
```
add all fields
```shell
pip install scrape-schema[all]
```

# Fields
## How it works
1. extract string from text
2. if it's not founded or empty - set `default` value
3. if it's iterable (not str) - call `filter_`, for first filter values
4. applies a callback function on a value. If value is iterable, applies for every element
5. if a `factory` function is passed - applies this for value, ignore auto type-cast and return a factored value
6. if factory is None - try to apply auto type-cast

Arguments eval steps:

1. parse value
2. if value None - return default
3. filter_ (if list/iterable)
4. eval callback elements
5. typing or factory

## About typing.Annotated 

This project usage [Annotated](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated)
[(PEP 593)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0593/) typehint for annotation fields 
and make the static type checker happy ðŸ˜€ and didn't need write a mypy plugin ðŸ¤¯.

**No annotation** - IDE marks attribute as "ReMatch" object (it's wrong)

![img_1.png](imgs/img_1.png)

Without **Annotated** type - static type checker marks as error

With **Annotated** - correct type, mypy OK

## About backend parsers
This library is not designed to work with structured formats like:

* cfg
* yaml
* toml
* json
* msgpack
* any structures

Use third-party libraries designed for these structures!
